## üåü Projects

### Python and Data Science
With the trend of AI and my love for Python, I've gained significant expertise and experience with it, especially with the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). My post-graduation final project involved creating a model to predict crypto market movements (no, I did not become rich üòÑ). 

You can check out and learn from my personal data science projects:
- [Credit Card Clients Data Science Project](https://github.com/ramondepieri/datascienceprojects/blob/main/credit_card_clients/credit_card_clients.ipynb)


### [UI - Automation Pure Java Selenium](https://github.com/ramondepieri/uiAutomationPureJavaSelenium)
This project is a pure Java Selenium framework for UI automation. While my current focus is on Python development, this project showcases my ability to ensure high-quality code through robust testing practices. It was a significant learning experience and a milestone in my career.

### [API - Automation Booking - RestAssured - Java](https://github.com/ramondepieri/apiAutomationBookingRestAssuredJava)
This project tests APIs using Rest Assured and Java. Java is incredible for this type of work; it performs efficiently and works like a charm. This project is another excellent resource for those interested in API automation testing.


## üé® Fun Facts

- I like to risk some chess moves and occasionally commit some "capybaras" (a playful term I use for blunders), like hanging my Queen sometimes üòÜ. Challenge me on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/ramondepieri) and let's have some fun!
