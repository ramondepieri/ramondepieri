## 🌟 Projects

### [uiAutomationPureJavaSelenium](https://github.com/ramondepieri/uiAutomationPureJavaSelenium)
This project is a pure Java Selenium framework for UI automation. It's a great starting point for those looking to begin a career in QA automation. I have fond memories from this time, as it was a significant learning experience and a milestone in my career.

### [apiAutomationBookingRestAssuredJava](https://github.com/ramondepieri/apiAutomationBookingRestAssuredJava)
This project tests APIs using Rest Assured and Java. Java is incredible for this type of work; it performs efficiently and works like a charm. This project is another excellent resource for those interested in API automation testing.

### Python and Data Science
With the trend of AI and my love for Python, I've gained significant expertise and experience with it, especially with the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). My post-graduation final project involved creating a model to predict crypto market movements (no, I did not become rich 😄). 

I'm currently venturing into studying and learning about Data Science. You can check out and learn from my personal project:

## 🎨 Fun Facts

- I like to risk some chess moves and occasionally commit some "capybaras" (a playful term I use for blunders), like hanging my Queen sometimes 😆. Challenge me on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/ramondepieri) and let's have some fun!
